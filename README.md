How It Works

1) The program asks the user to enter the first number(e.g., `5`).
2) Then it asks for a math operator(`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
3) Then it asks for the second number (e.g., `3`).
4) It performs the selected operation and prints the result.
5) If you try to divide by zero, it shows an error.
6) If you enter an invalid operator, it shows an error.
